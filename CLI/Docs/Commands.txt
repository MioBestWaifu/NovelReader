SYNTAX

Commands are structured as follows: prefixes (optional) action (required) options (some are optional, some not), modifiers key value (optional, may be any number);
An example would be: start (prefix) tracking (action) browser (required option for tracking action), end 16:00 (modifier key value), ignore youtube.com (modifier key value);

Actions are the main thing for Maria to understand what to do, and generally each action has its own module to handle it. 

Prefixes specify a broad general action on the action, when needed. So, the action track/tracking by itself always starts the tracking, if it isn't already, and by prefixing it with stop, pause, resume, etc, other broaad actions other than the standard may be taken. 

Options specify further the details of the command, with some options being required for generic actions. For example, tracking may be of browser or of the foregroung process, and it is required to specify which one. 

Modifiers are fully optional and tweak the standard behavior of the command. So, as an example, the tracking command by default continues until the user stops it explicitly or the machine shuts down, but by adding a "end time" modifier, the tracking will stop at the specified time.

Modifiers are separated from the the general command and each other by a comma. Furthermore, multiple commands may be given at once by separating them with a semicolon.

Multiple commands present another use for prefixes: determine order of execution. By default, Maria will try to execute all comands simultanously. This can be prevented by prefixing a command with "then", in which case Maria will execute the previous and command, then this one. For cases in which the previous command starts a continuos, long-running action that must finish before this command the prefix "after" must be used, as otherwise Maria will start the action then do this command.
