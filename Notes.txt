MORPHOLOGICAL ANALYSIS

To translate japanese, the EDRDG database (mainly JMDICT) is used. However, the entries there are (unsurprinsingly) 
in dictionary form. This means that to translate a flexioned verb, as an example, an unflexioned form of it must be determined.
To that end a morphological analysis tool is the best fit. The chosen tool is a wrapper of MeCab, that uses IPADIC as its 
dicionary by default. However, this package bundles the dictionary into it, so it may bloat Maria.Services final size by up to 50mb.
As of writing, this is unimportant. However, if size becomes a problem, another solution using the same analysis tool is to
use its python wrapper (mecab-python3), because it does not bundle a dictionary, and so the app would only bloat if the user
needs this funtion. This approach was not chosen at first because it is more convenient to use a C# wrapper in a C# project.
