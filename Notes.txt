MORPHOLOGICAL ANALYSIS

To translate japanese, the EDRDG database (mainly JMDICT) is used. However, the entries there are (unsurprinsingly) 
in dictionary form. This means that to translate a flexioned verb, as an example, an unflexioned form of it must be determined.
To that end a morphological analysis tool is the best fit. The chosen tool is a wrapper of MeCab, that uses IPADIC as its 
dicionary by default. However, this package bundles the dictionary into it, so it may bloat Maria.Services final size by up to 50mb.
As of writing, this is unimportant. However, if size becomes a problem, another solution using the same analysis tool is to
use its python wrapper (mecab-python3), because it does not bundle a dictionary, and so the app would only bloat if the user
needs this funtion. This approach was not chosen at first because it is more convenient to use a C# wrapper in a C# project.
Another option, of course, is to build our own wrapper, but that is a lot of work for a small gain.
Also, while using the current C# wrapper, it may be optimal do include unidic, since it is beter-maintained and more complete. It is also, however, very large and so will only be available as an option. 

JAPANESE SERIES NAMES

One of the files in the EDRDG database is a names dictionary. It contains names of people, places, and, i think, some art pieces like movies and anime.
It is likely that this file will be incomplete. So, it will probrably have to be expanded.
It is relatively easy and feasible to expand it, especially with anime-related things, because the japanese and english names
of them are easily obtainable from MAL. Other categories i do not know, but it is probably easy to find the english name if
we can determine that it is a art piece.
